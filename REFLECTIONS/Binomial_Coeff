                                              BINOMIAL COEFFICIENTS
The positive integers which are coefficients in binomial theorem are called as Binomial Coefficients.Generation of the Binomial 
Coefficients via programming:-
I)DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING(DP)
The binomial coefficient(nCk) generation can be programmed by DP because this problem can be divided into overlapping sub-problems and the sub 
problem can be represented by table.
  i)Method 1
  A 2-D array of 'n' rows and 'k' columns is generated and values in each cell can be stored from
